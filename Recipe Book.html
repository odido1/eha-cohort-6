    <h2><strong id="naijajollof">Jollof Rice</strong></h2>
<p>Jollof rice is one of the most simple and easy to make Nigerian food, you would want to start from here if you are new to Nigerian cooking.<br>
    Jollof rice is the most popular food in Africa and, the required ingredients are abundant in most countries of the world.<br>
    This is how we serve it in Nigeria. You can add fried  meat, fried plantain or even vegetable salad.

<p>Below is the list of ingredients required to succussfully cook a delious jollof rice;</p>
<ul id="fontfamily">
    4 cups of rice<br>
    1kg Chicken/beef(any protein of choice)<br>
    1000ml of Ground Fresh tomatoes<br>
    50ml Ground Fresh peppers<br>
    1 Teaspoon Curry powder<br>
    1 teaspoon Thyme<br>
    1 cup of groundnut oil<br>
    1 teaspoon Thyme<br>
    6 seasoning cubes<br>
    1 cup of sliced onions<br>
    300ml vegetable(optional)<br>
    pinch of salt to taste.<br>
    2 cloves of garlic(optional)<br>
    2 fingers of ginger(optional)<br>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Step by Step Preparation</strong></h4>
<p>These are the steps to follow to cook a delious jollof rice</p>
<h5><em><strong>step 1</strong></em></h5>
<p>Season the chicken/beef with a teaspoon of salt, one seasoning cubes, half a teaspoon each of curry and thyme, half a cup of sliced onions then let it sit for some minutes until it is halfed cooked.<br>
Set on heat and let it boil for 10-15 minutes, would take more time to cook the beef.<br></p>

<h5><em><strong>Step 2</strong></em></h5>
Set aside the meat and the stock in fresh bowls.<br>

Peel off the outer back of the ginger/garlic, pound, or grind.<br>

<h5><em><strong>Step 3</strong></em></h5>
Parboil rice the normal way, boil about 7 cups of water in a pot, add the four cups of rice and allow boiling for 3 minutes. Then pour out and wash thoroughly with clean water, then set aside in a bowl or plastic sieve.<br>

<h5><em><strong>Step 4</strong></em></h5>
Pick out the parboiled tasty meat and deep-fry, set aside.<br>

<h5><em><strong>Step 5</strong></em></h5>
Once you are done with frying the chicken, reduce the oil to 250ml (1 cup) just add the remaining one cup of sliced onions, stir for 1-2 minutes, add the ground tomatoes. I like to cook jollof rice with the same oil I used while frying the meat.<br>
Using a fresh oil is just the same as cooking without the beef stock (meat water) which actually holds over 70 percent of the ingredient that is used in making most Nigerian foods.<br>
The end result is not the same.<br>

<h5><em><strong>Step 6</strong></em></h5>
Frying the tomatoes would take about 20 minutes.<br>
Fry until when you lift a portion with your frying spoon, you will notice the oil continues to boil in the spoon.<br>
You also notice the tomatoes turning dark.<br>

<h5><em><strong>Step 7</strong></em></h5>
Once the tomato is well fried, add the meat water (chicken/beef stock) to the fried  tomato in the pot, the ground ginger/garlic, half a teaspoon each of curry and thyme, salt to taste, add 4 cups of water.<br>
Add another seasoning cube. Stir and taste, it should taste overly spiced. Donâ€™t worry, once the rice is added the taste would balance.<br>

<h5><em><strong>Step 8</strong></em></h5>
Add the rice.<br>
Then cover and allow the rice to cook on low heat for 30-45 minutes. Remember that you can add water occasionally.<br>

<p id="the-end">Viola!!! <br>
    Turn and serve with the fried meat or protein of choice.<br>
    This is just how to make jollof rice, you can serve with the fried meat, salad and maybe a bottle of your favorite drink
